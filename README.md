# AB-Testing

###AB Testing

It is one of the most commonly used tests in the field of data science

Let A represent a feature or group.

Let B represent another feature or group.

The topic of interest is whether there is a difference between A and B.

Hypothesis Testing: It is a statistical method used to test a belief or claim. The main purpose in group comparisons in AB tests in hypothesis testing is to try to demonstrate whether possible differences arise by chance or not.

The Two Sample Proportion Test that we will be interested in this project compares the proportions of two groups.

Hypothesis:

H0: p1 = p2

H1: p1 != p2

Depending on the resulting p-value;

If p-value < 0.05, H0 reject

So, there is a significant difference between the groups in terms of the ratios.

If p-value > 0.05, H0 cannot be rejected

So, there isn't a significant difference between the groups in terms of the ratios.
